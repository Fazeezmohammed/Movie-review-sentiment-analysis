# Movie-review-sentiment-analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using three Naive Bayes classifiers: GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, and BernoulliNB. BernoulliNB achieved the highest accuracy of 83%, outperforming the others. It works well with binary features and sparse data, making it ideal for text classification tasks.
